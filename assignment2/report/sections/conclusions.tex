In this document, we have described the creation of a toolchain designed to reconstruct software architecture based on Java source code. 
We have applied this toolchain on three Java projects in order to evaluate them.
When reviewing the produced class diagrams of eLib and the CyberNeko versions, we have spotted some issues with the tool, but we were still able to review the general structure of the projects.
When reading the mailing-lists of the CyberNeko project, we have been able to account for some of the changes in the class diagram between two different versions.
Concluding, we state that although the tool does not always function perfectly, we could discover interesting elements of the Java projects.
