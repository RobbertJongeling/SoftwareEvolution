\subsection{eLib}
In this first of two case studies, we consider the eLib benchmark as available from \url{http://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/2IS55/2011-2012/eLib.zip}.
The obtained class diagram is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eLib}, a larger version of this image is presented in appendix~\ref{app:eLib}.
