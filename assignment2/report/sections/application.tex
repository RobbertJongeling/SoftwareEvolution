\subsection{eLib}
In this first of two case studies, we consider the eLib benchmark as available from \url{http://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/2IS55/2011-2012/eLib.zip}.
The obtained class diagram is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eLib}.

\label{fig:eLib}
\end{figure}
The tool performs the task of outputting the file in several seconds. 
This is a reasonable time considering the relatively small size of eLib. 
The obtained diagram does not match the one presented in Figure~3.9 in the book by Tonella and Potrich~\cite{rev-eng} exactly. 
Our tool does not discover the dependency between the \texttt{Journal} class and the \texttt{User} class. 
Another difference is that they do not show the class \texttt{Main} in the class diagram and we do.
This is a loss of precision that is not desired but which we have not found the reason for in the code. %dit is een lelijke zin
The visual quality of the rendered image is good, the class diagram is readable and the general structure of eLib can be derived by looking at the diagram. 
We decided to generate only edges with straight corners because curved edges tend to give a very messy picture.
Also, we intersecting edges can be distinguished more easily when all edges are straight.

\subsection{CyberNeko HTML}
In this second case study, we compare two versions of the CyberNeko HTML Parser. 
We compare the obtained class diagrams of versions 0.9.5 (Figure~\ref{fig:neko0.9}) and 1.9.5 (Figure~\ref{fig:neko1.9}) and identify similarities and differences between the two versions and study the evolution of the project.
Finally, we try to relate observed changes in the diagrams to discussions on nekohtml-user and nekohtml-developer mailing lists to determine wether a change was explicitely required or rather a byproduct of other work.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sections/results/{{neko-0.9}}}
\caption{Class diagram obtained by running Graphviz on the dot file outputted by the developed tool applied on CyberNeko version 0.9.5.}
\label{fig:neko0.9}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[H]
\center
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sections/results/{{neko-1.9}}}
\caption{Class diagram obtained by running Graphviz on the dot file outputted by the developed tool applied on CyberNeko version 1.9.14.}
\label{fig:neko1.9}
\end{figure}

In a system as large as CyberNeko, it is of very little use to consider all small changes.
Therefore we identify three classes that seem the most important in CyberNeko version 0.9.5 and focus on them.
These are: \texttt{HTMLScanner}, \texttt{HTMLTagBalancer} and \texttt{ParserConfigurationSettings}.
In v1.9.14, the \texttt{HTMLScanner} class is associated with class \texttt{FilterInputStream}, this association was not present in v0.9.5. It was then associated with \texttt{PlaybackInputStream}, which extended \texttt{FilterInputStream}
The \texttt{HTMLTagBalancer} class is in v1.9.14 associated with class \texttt{ElementEntr}y, this association was not present in v0.9.5.
The class \texttt{ParserConfigurationSettings} stands out in the class diagram of v0.9.5 as three different classes depend on it. In v1.9.14, this has reduced to one.

The classes that are not connected to the rest of the classes (in the top right of the diagram), show little change over the versions. The quality of our tool can be doubted as there are some strange constructs apparant in the class diagram. Such as classes that have two dependencies to the same other class, classes that are associated with themselves or even a class that extends itself.

An interesting thing to notice in regard to the \texttt{nekohtml-developer} mailing list (which is used primarily to share patches and bug reports) is that it became active for the first time in December of 2007, when v0.9.5 was first released.
This level of activity was more of less maintained throughout 2008 and 2009.
After February of 2010, when v1.9.14 was released, the level of activity abruptly went down.
Since then, the activity level has never again been as high as between v0.9.5 and v1.9.15.
We expected that this might have been due to a practical reason, for instance the discussion moving to another platform, but we were not able to find any evidence of this, so we assume the project just became much less active after the release of v1.9.14.

The \texttt{nekohtml-user} mailing list (which is used for announcements and sometimes help) is much less consistent and it's hard to see any real patterns there.
The interesting part is that one of the few times that this list have been relatively active was in May of 2010, just after the developer mailing list became much less active.
