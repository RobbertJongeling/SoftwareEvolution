\subsection{eLib}
In this first of two case studies, we consider the eLib benchmark as available from \url{http://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/2IS55/2011-2012/eLib.zip}.
The obtained class diagram is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eLib}.

The tool performs the task of outputting the file in several seconds. 
This is a reasonable time considering the relatively small size of eLib. 
The obtained diagram does not match the one presented in Figure~3.9 in the book by Tonella and Potrich~\cite{rev-eng} exactly. 
Our tool does not discover the dependency between the \texttt{Journal} class and the \texttt{User} class. 
Another difference is that they do not show the class \texttt{Main} in the class diagram and we do.
This is a loss of precision that is not desired but which we have not found the reason for in the code. %dit is een lelijke zin
The visual quality of the rendered image is good, the class diagram is readable and the general structure of eLib can be derived by looking at the diagram. 
We decided to generate only edges with straight corners because curved edges tend to give a very messy picture.
Also, we intersecting edges can be distinguished more easily when all edges are straight.
