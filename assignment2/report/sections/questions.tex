This section describes some design choices we made while developing the toolchain.

\subsection{Input}
	\subsubsection{Support for inner classes}
		Yes, inner classes show up in the class diagram, but they don't look different because UML.
	\subsubsection{Support for generics}
		In return types/paramters, not in class diagram.
		Because we have no idea how to display them.

\subection{Output}
	\subsubsection{Named associations}
		No.
	\subsubsection{Multiplicities}
		We show the multiplicity for the fields, not on the association.
