This section describes some design choices we made while developing the toolchain.

\subsection{Input}
	\subsubsection{Support for inner classes}
		Our tool detects inner classes and adds them to the class diagram, complete with all fields and methods.
		
		However, we have not been able to find a UML class diagram specification for inner classes, so they look the same as regular classes.
	\subsubsection{Support for generics}
		We support generic types in paramters and return types, where we display the type that is required or returned.
		
		Again, we don't visualize generic classes themselves differently in the class diagram since we were not able to find a UML class diagram specification for them.

\subsection{Output}
	\subsubsection{Named associations}
		We don't support named associations, but we do display the name of the association in the field list.
	\subsubsection{Multiplicities}
		We show the multiplicity for the fields, not on the association edge itself.
