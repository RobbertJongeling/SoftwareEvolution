In this section we discuss the steps we perform to collect and analyze GitHub repositories.
In this research, we collect meta-data of GitHub repositories and use this meta-data to select large and active independent projects.
This meta-data can be queried using the relational database GHTorrent. \cite{ghtorrent}
Large and active independent projects are defined to be projects that:
\begin{itemize}
\item are not forks of other repositories,
\item have not been deleted,
\item have at least 10 different contributors,
\item have at least 10 changes (commits or pull requests) during the previous month,
\item are at least one year old,
\item have both commits and pull requests,
\item have been developed in Java, Python or Ruby.
\end{itemize}
Of these projects, we are interested in analyzing the ones that use Travis CI.
