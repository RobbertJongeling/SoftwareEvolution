In this report we study a number of large, active software projects using GitHub and Trevis, a repository hosting service and a continuous integration (CI) tool respectively.
Travis CI automatically builds a project when a change is made, such a change can be made by either a commit or a pull request.
The purpose of this study is to determine what, if any, differences of the probability of a build to fail there are between changes introduced by commits and changes introduced by pull requests.


In Section \ref{background}, we briefly discuss GitHub and Travis CI.
Next, in Section \ref{methodology}, we describe how we obtained the data and what analysis we have performed on the obtained data.
In Section \ref{results}, we present the obtained data and results of the statistical analysis.
Then, we briefly reflect on threats to the validity of our results in Section \ref{threats}.
