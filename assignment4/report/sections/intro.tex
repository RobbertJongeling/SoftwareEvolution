In this report we investigate a number of large, active software projects using GitHub and Trevis, respectively a hosting service and a continuous integration (CI) tool.
The purpose of this research is to determine what, if any, differences there are between the probability of a build to fail when the changes are introduced by a single commit or a pull request.

In Section \ref{background}, we briefly discuss GitHub and Travis CI.
Particularly how the functionality of GitHub is used in our research.
Next, in Section \ref{methodology}, we describe how we obtained the data and what analysis we have performed on the obtained data.
In Section \ref{results}, we present the obtained data and results of the statistical analysis.
Then, we briefly reflect on threats to the validity of our results in Section \ref{threats}.
