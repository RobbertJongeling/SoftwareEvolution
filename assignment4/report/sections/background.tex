In this section we discuss GitHub and Trevis CI.

\subsection{GitHub}
GitHub can be used to host software projects that use the GIT revision control system. 
The GitHub system provides a number of services related to managing these projects. 
A project is hosted in a repository. 
Several developers can contribute to a repository by means of commits. 
A different way of contributing to a repository is to fork the main development branch.
Then commit changes to that branch and when you want to integrate your changes into the main branch, issue a pull request.
Then a developer on the main branch that is entitled to do this will accept or deny the request.
On acceptance of the pull request, the changes made in the separate branch will be conducted in the main branch.

Furthermore, GitHub provides functionality to improve collaboration of multiple developers on the same project.
Issues can be created and assigned to a contributor. 
On every line of every commit any contributor can comment, this enhances the collaborative code review process.

\subsection{Travis CI}
