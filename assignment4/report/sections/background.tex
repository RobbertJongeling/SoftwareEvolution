In this section we discuss GitHub and Trevis CI.

\subsection{GitHub}
GitHub can be used to host software projects that use the GIT revision control system. 
The GitHub system provides a number of services related to managing these projects. 
A project is hosted in a repository. 
Several developers can contribute to a repository by means of commits. 
A different way of contributing to a repository is to fork the main development branch.
Then commit changes to that branch and when you want to integrate your changes into the main branch, issue a pull request.
Then a developer on the main branch that is entitled to do this will accept or deny the request.
