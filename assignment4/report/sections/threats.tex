%Threats to validity are influences that may limit our ability to interpret or draw conclusions from the study's data. \cite{challenges}
Our study relies on data available from GHTorrent. 
The correctness of this data is essential for the correctness of any analysis and conclusions we draw from it.
Related to that correctness, we note that some of the available data makes no sense at all.
We limit the dependency on GHTorrent by defining a data format for the collected data such that the calling of the Travis API and the subsequent statistical analysis can also be performed if the data is collected from another resource.

A second threat to validity is that when retrieving data from the Travis CI API, a number of projects returned a HTTP 500 error.
We decided to not look for this data in other manners but to skip these projects as we have enough other data.
We do not expect a large influence of the skipped projects on the end conclusions of the study.
